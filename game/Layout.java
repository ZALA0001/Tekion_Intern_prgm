/*PROBLEM STATEMENT-Week 2
ScoreBoard should be printed after every match (should contain overs done, Batting team, batsman, run on curr ball, total runs).
Feel free to enhance more also
Now make sure each player is defined as BatsMan or Bowler. Modify the random function to returns runs in high probability
than wicket for the Batsman.
